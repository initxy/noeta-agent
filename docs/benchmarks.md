# Noeta on public benchmarks

Where Noeta's `main` preset lands on public coding-agent benchmarks, run through
[harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) — the official
Terminal-Bench harness, the same one the public leaderboard uses. The harness,
the adapter, and the exact commands live in [`bench/`](../bench/README.md); this
file is the **published result**.

## Headline

| Benchmark | Scope | Noeta `main` (Claude Opus 4.8) | Field (public leaderboard) |
|-----------|-------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Terminal-Bench 2.1 | 40-task stratified sample | **82.5%** (33/40) | full-set board spans 58.7%–83.8% |
| SWE-bench Verified | 15-instance subset | **86.7%** (13/15) | field top ~79%, mid-pack ~66–77% |

Noeta clears the same tasks the field clears, on the same harness, judged by the
same verifiers. On Terminal-Bench 2.1 it resolves **82.5%** of the sample — the
top band of the full-set leaderboard (which spans 58.7%–83.8%), just under Claude
Code + Fable 5 (83.8%) and Codex + GPT-5.5 (83.1%), above every listed Claude
Code on Opus/Sonnet and every Terminus 2 entry. On a 15-instance SWE-bench
Verified subset it resolves **13/15**. Both run `Claude Opus 4.8` (the terminal
board at `xhigh`, SWE-bench at `high`). These are **samples**, labelled as such —
a placement in the field's band, not full-set leaderboard entries.

## Terminal-Bench 2.1 (40-task stratified sample)

- **Harness:** harbor 0.20.0, dataset `terminal-bench/terminal-bench-2-1`
  @ `sha256:7d7bdc1cbedad549fc1140404bd4dc45e5fd0ea7c4186773687d177ad3a0699a`
- **Agent:** `noeta-agent` 0.6.0 (`main` preset), deps `noeta-sdk`/`noeta-runtime` ≥0.6.10
- **Model:** `opus4.8`, reasoning effort `xhigh`
- **Command:** `NOETA_MODEL=opus4.8 NOETA_EFFORT=xhigh
  bench/run_benchmark.sh tb21-sample40` (the 40 task ids are pinned in that
  script's `TB_SAMPLE40` array, so the sample is re-runnable verbatim)

| Date | Scope | Resolved |
|------|-------|----------|
| 2026-08-10 | 40-task stratified sample (4 easy / 24 medium / 12 hard) | **33/40 = 82.5%** |

Resolved by difficulty:

| Difficulty | Resolved |
|------------|----------|
| easy | 4/4 (100%) |
| medium | 20/24 (83%) |
| hard | 9/12 (75%) |

**How the score is read.** The verdict of record is each task's own harbor
verifier (`X passed, 0 failed`), not whether the agent *process* exited cleanly.
The 7 misses are genuine — each carries a real `N failed` in its verifier output
(`build-cython-ext`, `chess-best-move`, `count-dataset-tokens`, `dna-assembly`,
`protein-assembly`, `raman-fitting`, `video-processing`).

## SWE-bench Verified (fixed subset)

- **Harness:** harbor, dataset `swe-bench/swe-bench-verified` (adapter converts
  Verified into harbor tasks; each is named `swe-bench/<instance_id>`)
- **Model:** `opus4.8`, reasoning effort `high`
- **Subset:** a fixed 15-instance set (not the full 500), one or two per repo
  across all 12 repos in Verified so the sample is not skewed to django's 231
  rows. Pinned in `run_benchmark.sh`'s `SWE_SUBSET15`.
- **Command:** `bench/run_benchmark.sh swe-15`

| Date | Subset size | Resolved |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 2026-08-09 | 15 | **13/15 = 86.7%** |

Two genuine misses (`django-11820`, `requests-1724`); the other 13 resolved.
SWE-bench Verified images ship Python 3.9–3.11, below noeta-agent's 3.12 floor,
so the adapter provisions a private 3.12 with `uv` before running (see
[`bench/README.md`](../bench/README.md)).

## What the harness covers

Noeta runs on harbor exactly as the field's agents do — it is a
`BaseInstalledAgent` (the same base class as harbor's `pi`, `codex`,
`claude-code`, `terminus` agents), installed into each task's container, driven
headless by `noeta run`, and scored by harbor's own per-task verifier. Nothing
about the scoring path is Noeta-specific.

- **Same datasets** — the official `terminal-bench/terminal-bench-2-1` and
  `swe-bench/swe-bench-verified` registry datasets, pinned by digest.
- **Same verifiers** — each task's own `test.sh` / verifier decides pass/fail;
  Noeta never scores itself.
- **Same comparison surface** — Terminal-Bench 2.1's public leaderboard is the
  reference for "the field" below.

### Coverage and exclusions

The 89-task TB2.1 set has a handful of tasks Noeta's harness cannot score for
reasons that are environment, not capability — stated here rather than hidden:

- **7 tasks** ship a base image with Python < 3.12 (five `python:3.10`/`3.11`
  images, plus two `qemu-*` tasks on `debian:bullseye` = 3.9), below
  noeta-agent's 3.12 floor. The adapter can now provision a private 3.12 with
  `uv` (the SWE-bench run uses that path), so this is not a hard limit; they stay
  out of *this* sample only so its composition stays fixed.
- **4 tasks** are not scoreable in a bounded run: `make-mips-interpreter`,
  `make-doom-for-mips`, `install-windows-3-11` (multi-hour timeout black holes)
  and `polyglot-rust-c` (tagged `no-verified-solution` — even the reference
  solution fails its own verifier). Excluded.

The 40-task sample is drawn from the remaining 78, stratified by difficulty.

## The field (public leaderboard, for context)

Terminal-Bench 2.1 numbers from the official leaderboard
([tbench.ai](https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.1)); SWE-bench
Verified from [swebench.com](https://www.swebench.com/). These are full-set
scores — cited for context, **not** directly comparable to Noeta's sample.

| Rank | Agent | Model | Effort | Terminal-Bench 2.1 |
|------|-------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | Claude Code | Fable 5 | xhigh | 83.8% ± 1.2% |
| 2 | Codex | GPT-5.5 | xhigh | 83.1% ± 1.1% |
| 3 | Terminus 2 | Fable 5 | high | 80.4% ± 1.2% |
| 5 | Claude Code | Opus 4.8 | high | 78.9% ± 1.3% |
| 7 | Terminus 2 | GPT-5.5 | xhigh | 78.0% ± 1.2% |
| 10 | Claude Code | Sonnet 5 | high | 74.6% ± 1.6% |
| 12 | Claude Code | Opus 4.7 | max | 68.9% ± 1.4% |
| 13 | Terminus 2 | Opus 4.7 | max | 66.1% ± 1.4% |
| 14 | Gemini CLI | Gemini 3 Pro | high | 65.8% ± 1.4% |
| 17 | Claude Code | GLM-5.1 | max | 58.7% ± 1.2% |

Source: [tbench.ai](https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.1) (17
entries; abridged above to the shipping CLIs + reference agent). The board spans
**58.7%–83.8%**; Noeta's **82.5%** sample lands in the top band — just under the
two leaders (Claude Code + Fable 5, Codex + GPT-5.5) and above every listed
Claude Code on Opus/Sonnet and every Terminus 2 entry. Read it as "in the top
band of the shipping agents," not a ranked position on identical tasks.

## Reproducibility

Every published number carries enough to re-run the identical evaluation: the
model id, the pinned dataset `name@version`, a copy-pasteable command, and —
for SWE-bench — the full instance-id list. The setup the harness needs (Docker,
proxy, wheel, model catalogue) is documented in [`bench/README.md`](../bench/README.md).

Cost is left unpriced: the run went through a gateway whose model id is not in
the SDK's pricing catalogue, so token totals are reported but dollar cost is not
fabricated.

## What this does not claim

- Not a full Terminal-Bench 2.1 (89) score — the 2026-08-10 row is a 40-task
  stratified sample, labelled as such.
- Not a full SWE-bench Verified (500) score — a fixed subset.
- Not a ranked leaderboard position — the 82.5% is a sample, placed in the
  field's band for context, not a head-to-head on identical tasks.
